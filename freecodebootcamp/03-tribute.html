                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>
                    Roman, nicknamed Romulus after the founder and first king of
                    Rome, is a snarky, masochistic, and brash individual who
                    thrives off of humiliation (both his own and others). In the
                    early days of the show, Roman played the part of court
                    jester, making crude remarks to his coworkers and
                    subordinates, and belittling anyone beneath his station due
                    to a deep insecurity brought on by his father's parental
                    tactics. As the show progresses, so does Roman. He becomes
                    more tactful, using the bullying and leverage learned from
                    his father in order to secure major deals for the company,
                    earning him a smidge of Logan's respect. Unfortunately,
                    Roman is still incredibly immature, and cost himself the
                    seat at his father's table after sending a lewd photo to one
                    of his superiors.
